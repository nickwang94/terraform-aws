# Save the Credentials

There are two ways that we can set these credentials for an AWS user, so that the terraform can pick it up, the first one is setting these credentials as environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
```

Then if you execute the `terraform plan`, it should be good.

> However, if I now switched to another terminal window, exporting environment variables and you will see that thoese two env variables are not set here.

You need to config here: `~/.aws/credentials`, where is a default location for storing AWS credentials on any operation system, then terraform can also pick it up.

The way to set these credentials is using aws configure
