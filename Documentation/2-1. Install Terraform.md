# Install Terraform

For mac, the easiest way to install terrform is to use `brew`.

```bash
➜  ~ brew install terraform
==> Fetching terraform
==> Downloading https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/homebrew-bottles/terraform-1.5.7.sonoma.bottle.1.tar.gz
################################################################################################################################### 100.0%
==> Pouring terraform-1.5.7.sonoma.bottle.1.tar.gz
==> Caveats
We will not accept any new Terraform releases in homebrew/core (with the BUSL license).
The next release changed to a non-open-source license:
https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license
See our documentation for acceptable licences:
  https://docs.brew.sh/License-Guidelines
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/terraform/1.5.7: 7 files, 65.7MB
==> Running `brew cleanup terraform`...
Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
```

Once you have it installed then you can use `terraform -v` to check.

```bash
➜  ~ terraform -v
Terraform v1.5.7
on darwin_amd64
